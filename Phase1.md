## Technical
After some discussion, we decided that using [Unity](https://unity.com/) was likely our best bet for this project. Unity is an incredibly powerful 3D engine that would let us do essentially everything in 3D space, and has an abundance of resources online to not only learn it in general, but also to troubleshoot issues and make specific libraries work with the engine as opposed to going in blind. 

Additionally, Unity has an AR framework called [AR Foundation](https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation) that has the benefits of being very well integrated in-engine, being cross-platform (the team is split between using iOS and Android phones, so this is important), and having a considerable amount of documentation and tutorials on the internet for such an emergent technology. 

Another quality of Unity that's also appealing is that since working in the Editor is a crucial part of developing in it, working with Unity is partly visual and not purely looking at code in a text editor. We figured this would make it easier to pick up than working purely with a programming language and an SDK like ARKit or ARCore - especially for the members of our team that aren't as experienced with programming already - and also make prototyping much easier and faster.
