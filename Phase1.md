## Aesthetics
We discussed the possibility of three different directions we could take the project in:
- More of a **performance art piece** interacts with the environment in particular ways to provide commentary on a point or produce visually striking content
- More of an **AR game** that uses the environment around the player as a setting or game mechanic -- or gamifies the AR experience generally
- More of an **interactive experience** that uses the environment as a medium to provide the user with something informational or educational

We unfortunately were not able to get the input of all group members before midnight, so the specifics are still up in the air and subject to change. The direction the discussion was headed with those that could contribute was towards the **AR game** and the **interactive experience**, but we are still waiting on opinions and ideas from all of the group members, so we cannot commit to anything without making sure everyone is on board with the direction we take the project in.

There was some talk about the potential of combining more than one of these ideas together for our project. One idea that was brought up was an interactive app that uses AR to lead the user to tourist destinations. The idea of doing something with urban gaming, as well as gamifying a static environent (ie. the home) was also mentioned. 

## Technical
After some discussion, we decided that using [Unity](https://unity.com/) was likely our best bet for this project. Unity is an incredibly powerful 3D engine that would let us do essentially everything in 3D space, and has an abundance of resources online to not only learn it in general, but also to troubleshoot issues and make specific libraries work with the engine as opposed to going in blind. 

Additionally, Unity has an AR framework called [AR Foundation](https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation) that has the benefits of being very well integrated in-engine, being cross-platform (the team is split between using iOS and Android phones, so this is important), and having a considerable amount of documentation and tutorials on the internet for such an emergent technology. 

Another quality of Unity that's also appealing is that since working in the Editor is a crucial part of developing in it, working with Unity is partly visual and not purely looking at code in a text editor. We figured this would make it easier to pick up than working purely with a programming language and an SDK like ARKit or ARCore - especially for the members of our team that aren't as experienced with programming already - and also make prototyping much easier and faster.
