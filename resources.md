Technical Resources:
1. https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation 
– Unity AR, possible engine to use to develop for AR can also export on multiple devices
2. https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/XRDevelopment/AR/HandheldAR/AROverview/ 
– Unreal AR, another engine, more C++ focused but the Blueprints in Unreal may help
3. https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/getting-started 
– ARCore, an example of an AR SDK for Android, this on in particular is supported by Google (if we go platform specific)
4. https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/ 
– iOS AR, linked an example of Android so here’s one of iOS, has links to also lead to resources and such
5. https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-ar-filters/ 
– Instagram AR, searching around for some ideas of how to develop AR for mobile devices I came across this article discussing how Instagram actually uses AR for some of it’s filters

Aesthetic Resources:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7AOAuIgGoo 
– Face Raiders 3DS Gameplay, possible similar app but minus the face capturing and instead base it off geographical location
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs 
– Pokemon GO, if we REALLY lean into the gameism of the project, would focus less on key locations
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTC2mnbkJsQ 
– Arcade shooter gameplay example, can do a sort of tour thing, guide people between tour locations, game and interactive things when you reach your destination kind of thing
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e6RK8o1fcs 
– Petscop, can go for an older design for things, low poly, low texture size, or in general a simple design
5. https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-earth-coming-end 
– Minecraft AR, allow for more interaction in the environment maybe
