# Phase 2
Aspen: On March 6th, I made [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hDfCDsrhlLVm2a4B6KsLZoRgAlrt4zVfvDOO5Z_GOk/) for people to put down any ideas they had, as well as their skills so we knew how to divide the work. Within a couple days, we got everyone to contribute at least somewhat to the document.

I had some concerns about one of the ideas covered in this document (the infographic/digital exhibit concept), so I tried to start up about a discussion about it on March 13th, but no one responded in time. At the time of writing this (March 16th), only one other person has responded to the messages (Shana), so I've been having to do pretty much everything thus far myself. I haven't been in contact with the rest of the group for a while, so I've more or less decided that we'll do my idea, I suppose.

My idea was to create a gamified AR experience that takes place in a static environment, rather than a constantly shifting one. Influenced by early examples of gamified AR like Nintendo's AR Cards and Face Raiders, it will use the player's current environment to make 3D objects appear in their space and use it as the setting for the game. We have to be careful not to keep the scope too big so it will have to be limited to a minigame, although I'm not exactly sure what to do yet. Some ideas I came up with included: a puzzle built by adding 3D structures to your environment with gameplay akin to Captain Toad or Pikmin; a virtual pet game akin to Nintendogs or Tamagotchi; a sporting minigame akin to Archery or Fishing from Nintendo's AR Cards; and something that takes input by the user drawing in the air akin to Scribblenauts (but this might be too complicated).

We did get everyone to fill in what they were good (and bad) at in the Google Doc, though. Personally (Aspen speaking), I'm good at programming, game design/development, project management, and some UI/UX design stuff, but I'm not great at art. Julia is good at 3D modelling and decent at anything art related, but not that good at coding. Philip is good with programming, game design, and some modelling. Shana is good at anything artistic as she comes from an architectural background, but she's not as good with programming (but learning). Yuejia is good with video editing, photography and Photoshop, or simple 3D modelling, but not as good with coding.

# Phase 1
## Aesthetics
We discussed the possibility of three different directions we could take the project in:
- More of a **performance art piece** interacts with the environment in particular ways to provide commentary on a point or produce visually striking content
- More of an **AR game** that uses the environment around the player as a setting or game mechanic -- or gamifies the AR experience generally
- More of an **interactive experience** that uses the environment as a medium to provide the user with something informational or educational

We unfortunately were not able to get the input of all group members before midnight, so the specifics are still up in the air and subject to change. The direction the discussion was headed with those that could contribute was towards the **AR game** and the **interactive experience**, but we are still waiting on opinions and ideas from all of the group members, so we cannot commit to anything without making sure everyone is on board with the direction we take the project in.

There was some talk about the potential of combining more than one of these ideas together for our project. One idea that was brought up was an interactive app that uses AR to lead the user to tourist destinations. The idea of doing something with urban gaming, as well as gamifying a static environent (ie. the home) was also mentioned. 

## Technical
After some discussion, we decided that using [Unity](https://unity.com/) was likely our best bet for this project. Unity is an incredibly powerful 3D engine that would let us do essentially everything in 3D space, and has an abundance of resources online to not only learn it in general, but also to troubleshoot issues and make specific libraries work with the engine as opposed to going in blind. 

Additionally, Unity has an AR framework called [AR Foundation](https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation) that has the benefits of being very well integrated in-engine, being cross-platform (the team is split between using iOS and Android phones, so this is important), and having a considerable amount of documentation and tutorials on the internet for such an emergent technology. 

Another quality of Unity that's also appealing is that since working in the Editor is a crucial part of developing in it, working with Unity is partly visual and not purely looking at code in a text editor. We figured this would make it easier to pick up than working purely with a programming language and an SDK like ARKit or ARCore - especially for the members of our team that aren't as experienced with programming already - and also make prototyping much easier and faster.
