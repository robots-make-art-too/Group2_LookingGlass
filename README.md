**ARPet** is an augmented reality application inspired by virtual pet games like Tamagotchi. Create and name your very own pet and take care of it by playing with and feeding it. Bring the marker of an object into frame for your pet to interact with it and have its stats boosted accordingly. The pet has multiple sprites that it will change between depending on its current stats. Make sure to regularly keep it happy, active and fed, or your pet may pass away.
