**ARPet** is an augmented reality application inspired by virtual pet games like Tamagotchi. Create and name your very own pet and take care of it by playing with and feeding it. Bring the marker of an object into frame for your pet to interact with it and have its stats boosted accordingly. The pet has multiple sprites that it will change between depending on its current stats. Make sure to regularly keep it happy, active and fed, or your pet may pass away.

One unique feature is how your pet's activity stat works! The game tracks your GPS coordinates and will award your pet at a rate of 10 activity points every 500 GPS steps (approx. 1250 feet / 380 metres). Please note that since it is GPS-based, it will not track steps in a small area accurately, and you will have to go for a walk where you are covering enough distance for it to track accurately.
