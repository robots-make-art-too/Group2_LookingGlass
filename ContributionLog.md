# Contribution Log
2022-02-14: The entire group had an early discussion about the project, which you can see in [DiscussionLog.md](DiscussionLog.md). Everyone pushed their resources to their GitHub branches, and Aspen merged all of them to main.

2022-03-06: Aspen created [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hDfCDsrhlLVm2a4B6KsLZoRgAlrt4zVfvDOO5Z_GOk/) for people to write their ideas and where their talents lied.

2022-03-08: Everyone filled out their skills in the Google Doc, and most people wrote a little bit in the ideas section.

2022-03-13: Aspen tried to start a conversation about the project for Phase 2, but didn't get any responses in time.

2022-03-19: Aspen finished the Phase 2 tasks, creating a GitHub pages website that has a QR code and button that takes you to a demo AR scene. Aspen also made the model - it is not very good (art is not my forte), and unexpectably ended up looking low-poly but it's kind of cool that way. (Sorry for the delay, a lot of my group members have just been absent so I haven't been able to move as quickly as I would have liked.)
